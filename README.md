# DATA602 Model Evaluation
## Data = pima_indian_data.csv

## Project Description:
The following will be done to the Pima Indian dataset

* Inspect the data and create a pipeline to perform any feature processing
* Prior to building the feature pipeline, be sure to split the data into training/test sets
* Create a logistic regression model pipeline that uses the above pipeline
* Pick a metric you are going to use to select the model and justify your choice.
* Use the above combined pipeline to run a Logistic Regression model with grid search cross-validation using 10 folds. Search 5 different regularization strengths and 2 solvers. * * What is the best model?
* Answer the question: How does it perform on the test set?

All of this will be done while im predicting the class column
